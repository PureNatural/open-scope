Useful for data loading and Hogwild training |\n| [**torch.utils**](https:\/\/pytorch.org\/docs\/stable\/data.html) | DataLoader and other utility functions for convenience |\n\nUsually, PyTorch is used either as:\n\n- A replacement for NumPy to use the power of GPUs.\n- A deep learning research platform that provides maximum flexibility and speed.\n\nElaborating Further:\n\n### A GPU-Ready Tensor Library\n\nIf you use NumPy, then you have used Tensors (a.k.a. ndarray).\n\n![Tensor illustration](.\/docs\/source\/_static\/img\/tensor_illustration.png)\n\nPyTorch provides Tensors that can live either on the CPU or the GPU and accelerates the\ncomputation by a huge amount.\n\nWe provide a wide variety of tensor routines to accelerate and fit your scientific computation needs\nsuch as slicing, indexing, mathematical operations, linear algebra, reductions.\nAnd they are fast!\n\n### Dynamic Neural Networks: Tape-Based Autograd\n\nPyTorch has a unique way of building neural networks: using and replaying a tape recorder.\n\nMost frameworks such as TensorFlow, Theano, Caffe, and CNTK have a static view of the world.\nOne has to build a neural network and reuse the same structure again and again.\nChanging the way the network behaves means that one has to start from scratch.\n\nWith PyTorch, we use a technique called reverse-mode auto-differentiation, which allows you to\nchange the way your network behaves arbitrarily with zero lag or overhead. Our inspiration comes\nfrom several research papers on this topic, as well as current and past work such as\n[torch-autograd](https:\/\/github.com\/twitter\/torch-autograd),\n[autograd](https:\/\/github.com\/HIPS\/autograd),\n[Chainer](https:\/\/chainer.org), etc.\n\nWhile this technique is not unique to PyTorch, it's one of the fastest implementations of it to date.\nYou get the best of speed and flexibility for your crazy research.\n\n![Dynamic graph](https:\/\/github.com\/pytorch\/pytorch\/raw\/main\/docs\/source\/_static\/img\/dynamic_graph.gif)\n\n### Python First\n\nPyTorch is not a Python binding into a monolithic C++ framework.\nIt is built to be deeply integrated into Python.\nYou can use it naturally like you would use [NumPy](https:\/\/www.numpy.org\/) \/ [SciPy](https:\/\/www.scipy.org\/) \/ [scikit-learn](https:\/\/scikit-learn.org) etc.\nYou can write your new neural network layers in Python itself, using your favorite libraries\nand use packages such as [Cython](https:\/\/cython.org\/) and [Numba](http:\/\/numba.pydata.org\/).\nOur goal is to not reinvent the wheel where appropriate.\n\n### Imperative Experiences\n\nPyTorch is designed to be intuitive, linear in thought, and easy to use.\nWhen you execute a line of code, it gets executed. There isn't an asynchronous view of the world.\nWhen you drop into a debugger or receive error messages and stack traces, understanding them is straightforward.\nThe stack trace points to exactly where your code was defined.\nWe hope you never spend hours debugging your code because of bad stack traces or asynchronous and opaque execution engines.\n\n### Fast and Lean\n\nPyTorch has minimal framework overhead. We integrate acceleration libraries\nsuch as [Intel MKL](https:\/\/software.intel.com\/mkl) and NVIDIA ([cuDNN](https:\/\/developer.nvidia.com\/cudnn), [NCCL](https:\/\/developer.nvidia.com\/nccl)) to maximize speed.\nAt the core, its CPU and GPU Tensor and neural network backends\nare mature and have been tested for years.\n\nHence, PyTorch is quite fast — whether you run small or large neural networks.\n\nThe memory usage in PyTorch is extremely efficient compared to Torch or some of the alternatives.\nWe've written custom memory allocators for the GPU to make sure that\nyour deep learning models are maximally memory efficient.\nThis enables you to train bigger deep learning models than before.\n\n### Extensions Without Pain\n\nWriting new neural network modules, or interfacing with PyTorch's Tensor API was designed to be straightforward\nand with minimal abstractions.\n\nYou can write new neural network layers in Python using the torch API\n[or your favorite NumPy-based libraries such as SciPy](https:\/\/pytorch.org\/tutorials\/advanced\/numpy_extensions_tutorial.html).\n\nIf you want to write your layers in C\/C++, we provide a convenient extension API that is efficient and with minimal boilerplate.\nNo wrapper code needs to be written. You can see [a tutorial here](https:\/\/pytorch.org\/tutorials\/advanced\/cpp_extension.html) and [an example here](https:\/\/github.com\/pytorch\/extension-cpp).\n\n\n## Installation\n\n### Binaries\nCommands to install binaries via Conda or pip wheels are on our website: [https:\/\/pytorch.org\/get-started\/locally\/](https:\/\/pytorch.org\/get-started\/locally\/)\n\n\n#### NVIDIA Jetson Platforms\n\nPython wheels for NVIDIA's Jetson Nano, Jetson TX1\/TX2, Jetson Xavier NX\/AGX, and Jetson AGX Orin are provided [here](https:\/\/forums.developer.nvidia.com\/t\/pytorch-for-jetson-version-1-10-now-available\/72048) and the L4T container is published [here](https:\/\/catalog.ngc.nvidia.com\/orgs\/nvidia\/containers\/l4t-pytorch)\n\nThey require JetPack 4.2 and above, and [@dusty-nv](https:\/\/github.com\/dusty-nv) and [@ptrblck](https:\/\/github.com\/ptrblck) are maintaining them.\n\n\n### From Source\n\n#### Prerequisites\nIf you are installing from source, you will need:\n- Python 3.9 or later\n- A compiler that fully supports C++17, such as clang or gcc (gcc 9.4.0 or newer is required, on Linux)\n- Visual Studio or Visual Studio Build Tool (Windows only)\n\n\\* PyTorch CI uses Visual C++ BuildTools, which come with Visual Studio Enterprise,\nProfessional, or Community Editions. You can also install the build tools from\nhttps:\/\/visualstudio.microsoft.com\/visual-cpp-build-tools\/. The build tools *do not*\ncome with Visual Studio Code by default.\n\n\\* We highly recommend installing an [Anaconda](https:\/\/www.anaconda.com\/download) environment. You will get a high-quality BLAS library (MKL) and you get controlled dependency versions regardless of your Linux distro.\n\nAn example of environment setup is shown below:\n\n* Linux:\n\n```bash\n$ source <CONDA_INSTALL_DIR>\/bin\/activate\n$ conda create -y -n <CONDA_NAME>\n$ conda activate <CONDA_NAME>\n```\n\n* Windows:\n\n```bash\n$ source <CONDA_INSTALL_DIR>\\Scripts\\activate.bat\n$ conda create -y -n <CONDA_NAME>\n$ conda activate <CONDA_NAME>\n$ call \"C:\\Program Files\\Microsoft Visual Studio\\<VERSION>\\Community\\VC\\Auxiliary\\Build\\vcvarsall.bat\" x64\n```\n\n##### NVIDIA CUDA Support\nIf you want to compile with CUDA support, [select a supported version of CUDA from our support matrix](https:\/\/pytorch.org\/get-started\/locally\/), then install the following:\n- [NVIDIA CUDA](https:\/\/developer.nvidia.com\/cuda-downloads)\n- [NVIDIA cuDNN](https:\/\/developer.nvidia.com\/cudnn) v8.5 or above\n- [Compiler](https:\/\/gist.github.com\/ax3l\/9489132) compatible with CUDA\n\nNote: You could refer to the [cuDNN Support Matrix](https:\/\/docs.nvidia.com\/deeplearning\/cudnn\/reference\/support-matrix.html) for cuDNN versions with the various supported CUDA, CUDA driver and NVIDIA hardware\n\nIf you want to disable CUDA support, export the environment variable `USE_CUDA=0`.\nOther potentially useful environment variables may be found in `setup.py`.\n\nIf you are building for NVIDIA's Jetson platforms (Jetson Nano, TX1, TX2, AGX Xavier), Instructions to install PyTorch for Jetson Nano are [available here](https:\/\/devtalk.nvidia.com\/default\/topic\/1049071\/jetson-nano\/pytorch-for-jetson-nano\/)\n\n##### AMD ROCm Support\nIf you want to compile with ROCm support, install\n- [AMD ROCm](https:\/\/rocm.docs.amd.com\/en\/latest\/deploy\/linux\/quick_start.html) 4.0 and above installation\n- ROCm is currently supported only for Linux systems.\n\nBy default the build system expects ROCm to be installed in `\/opt\/rocm`. If ROCm is installed in a different directory, the `ROCM_PATH` environment variable must be set to the ROCm installation directory. The build system automatically detects the AMD GPU architecture. Optionally, the AMD GPU architecture can be explicitly set with the `PYTORCH_ROCM_ARCH` environment variable [AMD GPU architecture](https:\/\/rocm.docs.amd.com\/projects\/install-on-linux\/en\/latest\/reference\/system-requirements.html#supported-gpus)\n\nIf you want to disable ROCm support, export the environment variable `USE_ROCM=0`.\nOther potentially useful environment variables may be found in `setup.py`.\n\n##### Intel GPU Support\nIf you want to compile with Intel GPU support, follow these\n- [PyTorch Prerequisites for Intel GPUs](https:\/\/www.intel.com\/content\/www\/us\/en\/developer\/articles\/tool\/pytorch-prerequisites-for-intel-gpus.html) instructions.\n- Intel GPU is supported for Linux and Windows.\n\nIf you want to disable Intel GPU support, export the environment variable `USE_XPU=0`.\nOther potentially useful environment variables may be found in `setup.py`.\n\n#### Get the PyTorch Source\n```bash\ngit clone --recursive https:\/\/github.com\/pytorch\/pytorch\ncd pytorch\n# if you are updating an existing checkout\ngit submodule sync\ngit submodule update --init --recursive\n```\n\n#### Install Dependencies\n\n**Common**\n\n```bash\nconda install cmake ninja\n# Run this command from the PyTorch directory after cloning the source code using the “Get the PyTorch Source“ section below\npip install -r requirements.txt\n```\n\n**On Linux**\n\n```bash\npip install mkl-static mkl-include\n# CUDA only: Add LAPACK support for the GPU if needed\nconda install -c pytorch magma-cuda121  # or the magma-cuda* that matches your CUDA version from https:\/\/anaconda.org\/pytorch\/repo\n\n# (optional) If using torch.compile with inductor\/triton, install the matching version of triton\n# Run from the pytorch directory after cloning\n# For Intel GPU support, please explicitly `export USE_XPU=1` before running command.\nmake triton\n```\n\n**On MacOS**\n\n```bash\n# Add this package on intel x86 processor machines only\npip install mkl-static mkl-include\n# Add these packages if torch.distributed is needed\nconda install pkg-config libuv\n```\n\n**On Windows**\n\n```bash\npip install mkl-static mkl-include\n# Add these packages if torch.distributed is needed.\n# Distributed package support on Windows is a prototype feature and is subject to changes.\nconda install -c conda-forge libuv=1.39\n```\n\n#### Install PyTorch\n**On Linux**\n\nIf you would like to compile PyTorch with [new C++ ABI](https:\/\/gcc.gnu.org\/onlinedocs\/libstdc++\/manual\/using_dual_abi.html) enabled, then first run this command:\n```bash\nexport _GLIBCXX_USE_CXX11_ABI=1\n```\n\nPlease **note** that starting from PyTorch 2.5, the PyTorch build with XPU supports both new and old C++ ABIs. Previously, XPU only supported the new C++ ABI. If you want to compile with Intel GPU support, please follow [Intel GPU Support](#intel-gpu-support).\n\nIf you're compiling for AMD ROCm then first run this command:\n```bash\n# Only run this if you're compiling for ROCm\npython tools\/amd_build\/build_amd.py\n```\n\nInstall PyTorch\n```bash\nexport CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=\"${CONDA_PREFIX:-'$(dirname $(which conda))\/..\/'}:${CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH}\"\npython setup.py develop\n```\n\n**On macOS**\n\n```bash\npython3 setup.py develop\n```\n\n**On Windows**\n\nIf you want to build legacy python code, please refer to [Building on legacy code and CUDA](https:\/\/github.com\/pytorch\/pytorch\/blob\/main\/CONTRIBUTING.md#building-on-legacy-code-and-cuda)\n\n**CPU-only builds**\n\nIn this mode PyTorch computations will run on your CPU, not your GPU\n\n```cmd\npython setup.py develop\n```\n\nNote on OpenMP: The desired OpenMP implementation is Intel OpenMP (iomp). In order to link against iomp, you'll need to manually download the library and set up the building environment by tweaking `CMAKE_INCLUDE_PATH` and `LIB`. The instruction [here](https:\/\/github.com\/pytorch\/pytorch\/blob\/main\/docs\/source\/notes\/windows.rst#building-from-source) is an example for setting up both MKL and Intel OpenMP. Without these configurations for CMake, Microsoft Visual C OpenMP runtime (vcomp) will be used.\n\n**CUDA based build**\n\nIn this mode PyTorch computations will leverage your GPU via CUDA for faster number crunching\n\n[NVTX](https:\/\/docs.nvidia.com\/gameworks\/content\/gameworkslibrary\/nvtx\/nvidia_tools_extension_library_nvtx.htm) is needed to build Pytorch with CUDA.\nNVTX is a part of CUDA distributive, where it is called \"Nsight Compute\". To install it onto an already installed CUDA run CUDA installation once again and check the corresponding checkbox.\nMake sure that CUDA with Nsight Compute is installed after Visual Studio.\n\nCurrently, VS 2017 \/ 2019, and Ninja are supported as the generator of CMake. If `ninja.exe` is detected in `PATH`, then Ninja will be used as the default generator, otherwise, it will use VS 2017 \/ 2019.\n<br\/> If Ninja is selected as the generator, the latest MSVC will get selected as the underlying toolchain.\n\nAdditional libraries such as\n[Magma](https:\/\/developer.nvidia.com\/magma), [oneDNN, a.k.a. MKLDNN or DNNL](https:\/\/github.com\/oneapi-src\/oneDNN), and [Sccache](https:\/\/github.com\/mozilla\/sccache) are often needed. Please refer to the [installation-helper](https:\/\/github.com\/pytorch\/pytorch\/tree\/main\/.ci\/pytorch\/win-test-helpers\/installation-helpers) to install them.\n\nYou can refer to the [build_pytorch.bat](https:\/\/github.com\/pytorch\/pytorch\/blob\/main\/.ci\/pytorch\/win-test-helpers\/build_pytorch.bat) script for some other environment variables configurations\n\n\n```cmd\ncmd\n\n:: Set the environment variables after you have downloaded and unzipped the mkl package,\n:: else CMake would throw an error as `Could NOT find OpenMP`.\nset CMAKE_INCLUDE_PATH={Your directory}\\mkl\\include\nset LIB={Your directory}\\mkl\\lib;%LIB%\n\n:: Read the content in the previous section carefully before you proceed.\n:: [Optional] If you want to override the underlying toolset used by Ninja and Visual Studio with CUDA, please run the following script block.\n:: \"Visual Studio 2019 Developer Command Prompt\" will be run automatically.\n:: Make sure you have CMake >= 3.12 before you do this when you use the Visual Studio generator.\nset CMAKE_GENERATOR_TOOLSET_VERSION=14.27\nset DISTUTILS_USE_SDK=1\nfor \/f \"usebackq tokens=*\" %i in (`\"%ProgramFiles(x86)%\\Microsoft Visual Studio\\Installer\\vswhere.exe\" -version [15^,17^) -products * -latest -property installationPath`) do call \"%i\\VC\\Auxiliary\\Build\\vcvarsall.bat\" x64 -vcvars_ver=%CMAKE_GENERATOR_TOOLSET_VERSION%\n\n:: [Optional] If you want to override the CUDA host compiler\nset CUDAHOSTCXX=C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Microsoft Visual Studio\\2019\\Community\\VC\\Tools\\MSVC\\14.27.29110\\bin\\HostX64\\x64\\cl.exe\n\npython setup.py develop\n\n```\n\n##### Adjust Build Options (Optional)\n\nYou can adjust the configuration of cmake variables optionally (without building first), by doing\nthe following. For example, adjusting the pre-detected directories for CuDNN or BLAS can be done\nwith such a step.\n\nOn Linux\n```bash\nexport CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=\"${CONDA_PREFIX:-'$(dirname $(which conda))\/..\/'}:${CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH}\"\npython setup.py build --cmake-only\nccmake build  # or cmake-gui build\n```\n\nOn macOS\n```bash\nexport CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=\"${CONDA_PREFIX:-'$(dirname $(which conda))\/..\/'}:${CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH}\"\nMACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET=10.9 CC=clang CXX=clang++ python setup.py build --cmake-only\nccmake build  # or cmake-gui build\n```\n\n### Docker Image\n\n#### Using pre-built images\n\nYou can also pull a pre-built docker image from Docker Hub and run with docker v19.03+\n\n```bash\ndocker run --gpus all --rm -ti --ipc=host pytorch\/pytorch:latest\n```\n\nPlease note that PyTorch uses shared memory to share data between processes, so if torch multiprocessing is used (e.g.\nfor multithreaded data loaders) the default shared memory segment size that container runs with is not enough, and you\nshould increase shared memory size either with `--ipc=host` or `--shm-size` command line options to `nvidia-docker run`.\n\n#### Building the image yourself\n\n**NOTE:** Must be built with a docker version > 18.06\n\nThe `Dockerfile` is supplied to build images with CUDA 11.1 support and cuDNN v8.\nYou can pass `PYTHON_VERSION=x.y` make variable to specify which Python version is to be used by Miniconda, or leave it\nunset to use the default.\n\n```bash\nmake -f docker.Makefile\n# images are tagged as docker.io\/${your_docker_username}\/pytorch\n```\n\nYou can also pass the `CMAKE_VARS=\"...\"` environment variable to specify additional CMake variables to be passed to CMake during the build.\nSee [setup.py](.\/setup.py) for the list of available variables.\n\n```bash\nmake -f docker.Makefile\n```\n\n### Building the Documentation\n\nTo build documentation in various formats, you will need [Sphinx](http:\/\/www.sphinx-doc.org) and the\nreadthedocs theme.\n\n```bash\ncd docs\/\npip install -r requirements.txt\nmake html\nmake serve\n```\n\nRun `make` to get a list of all available output formats.\n\nIf you get a katex error run `npm install katex`.  If it persists, try\n`npm install -g katex`\n\n> Note: if you installed `nodejs` with a different package manager (e.g.,\n`conda`) then `npm` will probably install a version of `katex` that is not\ncompatible with your version of `nodejs` and doc builds will fail.\nA combination of versions that is known to work is `node@6.13.1` and\n`katex@0.13.18`. To install the latter with `npm` you can run\n```npm install -g katex@0.13.18```\n\n### Previous Versions\n\nInstallation instructions and binaries for previous PyTorch versions may be found\non [our website](https:\/\/pytorch.org\/previous-versions).\n\n\n## Getting Started\n\nThree-pointers to get you started:\n- [Tutorials: get you started with understanding and using PyTorch](https:\/\/pytorch.org\/tutorials\/)\n- [Examples: easy to understand PyTorch code across all domains](https:\/\/github.com\/pytorch\/examples)\n- [The API Reference](https:\/\/pytorch.org\/docs\/)\n- [Glossary](https:\/\/github.com\/pytorch\/pytorch\/blob\/main\/GLOSSARY.md)\n\n## Resources\n\n* [PyTorch.org](https:\/\/pytorch.org\/)\n* [PyTorch Tutorials](https:\/\/pytorch.org\/tutorials\/)\n* [PyTorch Examples](https:\/\/github.com\/pytorch\/examples)\n* [PyTorch Models](https:\/\/pytorch.org\/hub\/)\n* [Intro to Deep Learning with PyTorch from Udacity](https:\/\/www.udacity.com\/course\/deep-learning-pytorch--ud188)\n* [Intro to Machine Learning with PyTorch from Udacity](https:\/\/www.udacity.com\/course\/intro-to-machine-learning-nanodegree--nd229)\n* [Deep Neural Networks with PyTorch from Coursera](https:\/\/www.coursera.org\/learn\/deep-neural-networks-with-pytorch)\n* [PyTorch Twitter](https:\/\/twitter.com\/PyTorch)\n* [PyTorch Blog](https:\/\/pytorch.org\/blog\/)\n* [PyTorch YouTube](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/channel\/UCWXI5YeOsh03QvJ59PMaXFw)\n\n## Communication\n* Forums: Discuss implementations, research, etc. https:\/\/discuss.pytorch.org\n* GitHub Issues: Bug reports, feature requests, install issues, RFCs, thoughts, etc.\n* Slack: The [PyTorch Slack](https:\/\/pytorch.slack.com\/) hosts a primary audience of moderate to experienced PyTorch users and developers for general chat, online discussions, collaboration, etc. If you are a beginner looking for help, the primary medium is [PyTorch Forums](https:\/\/discuss.pytorch.org).

For example, the [node debug adapter](https:\/\/github.com\/microsoft\/vscode-node-debug) and the [mono debug adapter](https:\/\/github.com\/microsoft\/vscode-mono-debug) repositories are separate from each other. For a complete list, please visit the [Related Projects](https:\/\/github.com\/microsoft\/vscode\/wiki\/Related-Projects) page on our [wiki](https:\/\/github.com\/microsoft\/vscode\/wiki).\n\n## Bundled Extensions\n\nVS Code includes a set of built-in extensions located in the [extensions](extensions) folder, including grammars and snippets for many languages. Extensions that provide rich language support (code completion, Go to Definition) for a language have the suffix `language-features`. For example, the `json` extension provides coloring for `JSON` and the `json-language-features` extension provides rich language support for `JSON`.\n\n## Development Container\n\nThis repository includes a Visual Studio Code Dev Containers \/ GitHub Codespaces development container.\n\n* For [Dev Containers](https:\/\/aka.ms\/vscode-remote\/download\/containers), use the **Dev Containers: Clone Repository in Container Volume...** command which creates a Docker volume for better disk I\/O on macOS and Windows.\n  * If you already have VS Code and Docker installed, you can also click [here](https:\/\/vscode.dev\/redirect?url=vscode:\/\/ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers\/cloneInVolume?url=https:\/\/github.com\/microsoft\/vscode) to get started. This will cause VS Code to automatically install the Dev Containers extension if needed, clone the source code into a container volume, and spin up a dev container for use.\n\n* For Codespaces, install the [GitHub Codespaces](https:\/\/marketplace.visualstudio.com\/items?itemName=GitHub.codespaces) extension in VS Code, and use the **Codespaces: Create New Codespace** command.\n\nDocker \/ the Codespace should have at least **4 Cores and 6 GB of RAM (8 GB recommended)** to run full build.

Games can\nbe exported with one click to a number of platforms, including the major desktop\nplatforms (Linux, macOS, Windows), mobile platforms (Android, iOS), as well as\nWeb-based platforms and [consoles](https:\/\/docs.godotengine.org\/en\/latest\/tutorials\/platform\/consoles.html).\n\n## Free, open source and community-driven\n\nGodot is completely free and open source under the very permissive [MIT license](https:\/\/godotengine.org\/license).\nNo strings attached, no royalties, nothing. The users' games are theirs, down\nto the last line of engine code. Godot's development is fully independent and\ncommunity-driven, empowering users to help shape their engine to match their\nexpectations. It is supported by the [Godot Foundation](https:\/\/godot.foundation\/)\nnot-for-profit.\n\nBefore being open sourced in [February 2014](https:\/\/github.com\/godotengine\/godot\/commit\/0b806ee0fc9097fa7bda7ac0109191c9c5e0a1ac),\nGodot had been developed by [Juan Linietsky](https:\/\/github.com\/reduz) and\n[Ariel Manzur](https:\/\/github.com\/punto-) (both still maintaining the project)\nfor several years as an in-house engine, used to publish several work-for-hire\ntitles.\n\n![Screenshot of a 3D scene in the Godot Engine editor](https:\/\/raw.githubusercontent.com\/godotengine\/godot-design\/master\/screenshots\/editor_tps_demo_1920x1080.jpg)\n\n## Getting the engine\n\n### Binary downloads\n\nOfficial binaries for the Godot editor and the export templates can be found\n[on the Godot website](https:\/\/godotengine.org\/download).\n\n### Compiling from source\n\n[See the official docs](https:\/\/docs.godotengine.org\/en\/latest\/contributing\/development\/compiling)\nfor compilation instructions for every supported platform.\n\n## Community and contributing\n\nGodot is not only an engine but an ever-growing community of users and engine\ndevelopers. The main community channels are listed [on the homepage](https:\/\/godotengine.org\/community).\n\nThe best way to get in touch with the core engine developers is to join the\n[Godot Contributors Chat](https:\/\/chat.godotengine.org).\n\nTo get started contributing to the project, see the [contributing guide](CONTRIBUTING.md).\nThis document also includes guidelines for reporting bugs.\n\n## Documentation and demos\n\nThe official documentation is hosted on [Read the Docs](https:\/\/docs.godotengine.org).\nIt is maintained by the Godot community in its own [GitHub repository](https:\/\/github.com\/godotengine\/godot-docs).\n\nThe [class reference](https:\/\/docs.godotengine.org\/en\/latest\/classes\/)\nis also accessible from the Godot editor.\n\nWe also maintain official demos in their own [GitHub repository](https:\/\/github.com\/godotengine\/godot-demo-projects)\nas well as a list of [awesome Godot community resources](https:\/\/github.com\/godotengine\/awesome-godot).\n\nThere are also a number of other\n[learning resources](https:\/\/docs.godotengine.org\/en\/latest\/community\/tutorials.html)\nprovided by the community, such as text and video tutorials, demos, etc.\nConsult the [community channels](https:\/\/godotengine.org\/community)\nfor more information.\n\n[![Code Triagers Badge](https:\/\/www.codetriage.com\/godotengine\/godot\/badges\/users.svg)](https:\/\/www.codetriage.com\/godotengine\/godot)\n[![Translate on Weblate](https:\/\/hosted.weblate.org\/widgets\/godot-engine\/-\/godot\/svg-badge.svg)](https:\/\/hosted.weblate.org\/engage\/godot-engine\/?utm_source=widget)\n[![TODOs](https:\/\/badgen.net\/https\/api.tickgit.com\/badgen\/github.com\/godotengine\/godot)](https:\/\/www.tickgit.com\/browse?repo=github.com\/godotengine\/godot)\n",

		"a.readme_text" : "# Kibana\n\nKibana is your window into the [Elastic Stack](https:\/\/www.elastic.co\/products). Specifically, it's a browser-based analytics and search dashboard for Elasticsearch.\n\n- [Getting Started](#getting-started)\n  - [Using a Kibana Release](#using-a-kibana-release)\n  - [Building and Running Kibana, and\/or Contributing Code](#building-and-running-kibana-andor-contributing-code)\n- [Documentation](#documentation)\n- [Version Compatibility with Elasticsearch](#version-compatibility-with-elasticsearch)\n- [Questions? Problems? Suggestions?](#questions-problems-suggestions)\n\n## Getting Started\n\nIf you just want to try Kibana out, check out the [Elastic Stack Getting Started Page](https:\/\/www.elastic.co\/start) to give it a whirl.\n\nIf you're interested in diving a bit deeper and getting a taste of Kibana's capabilities, head over to the [Kibana Getting Started Page](https:\/\/www.elastic.co\/guide\/en\/kibana\/current\/get-started.html).\n\n### Using a Kibana Release\n\nIf you want to use a Kibana release in production, give it a test run, or just play around:\n\n- Download the latest version on the [Kibana Download Page](https:\/\/www.elastic.co\/downloads\/kibana).\n- Learn more about Kibana's features and capabilities on the\n[Kibana Product Page](https:\/\/www.elastic.co\/products\/kibana).\n- We also offer a hosted version of Kibana on our\n[Cloud Service](https:\/\/www.elastic.co\/cloud\/as-a-service).\n\n### Building and Running Kibana, and\/or Contributing Code\n\nYou might want to build Kibana locally to contribute some code, test out the latest features, or try\nout an open PR:\n\n- [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) will help you get Kibana up and running.\n- If you would like to contribute code, please follow our [STYLEGUIDE.mdx](STYLEGUIDE.mdx).\n- For all other questions, check out the [FAQ.md](FAQ.md) and\n[wiki](https:\/\/github.com\/elastic\/kibana\/wiki).\n\n## Documentation\n\nVisit [Elastic.co](http:\/\/www.elastic.co\/guide\/en\/kibana\/current\/index.html) for the full Kibana documentation.\n\nFor information about building the documentation, see the README in [elastic\/docs](https:\/\/github.com\/elastic\/docs).\n\n## Version Compatibility with Elasticsearch\n\nIdeally, you should be running Elasticsearch and Kibana with matching version numbers. If your Elasticsearch has an older version number or a newer _major_ number than Kibana, then Kibana will fail to run. If Elasticsearch has a newer minor or patch number than Kibana, then the Kibana Server will log a warning.\n\n_Note: The version numbers below are only examples, meant to illustrate the relationships between different types of version numbers._\n\n| Situation                 | Example Kibana version     | Example ES version | Outcome |\n| ------------------------- | -------------------------- |------------------- | ------- |\n| Versions are the same.    | 7.15.1                     | 7.15.1             | 💚 OK      |\n| ES patch number is newer. | 7.15.__0__                 | 7.15.__1__         | ⚠️ Logged warning      |\n| ES minor number is newer. | 7.__14__.2                 | 7.__15__.0         | ⚠️ Logged warning      |\n| ES major number is newer. | __7__.15.1                 | __8__.0.0          | 🚫 Fatal error      |\n| ES patch number is older. | 7.15.__1__                 | 7.15.__0__         | ⚠️ Logged warning      |\n| ES minor number is older. | 7.__15__.1                 | 7.__14__.2         | 🚫 Fatal error      |\n| ES major number is older. | __8__.0.0                  | __7__.15.1         | 🚫 Fatal error      |\n\n## Questions?
